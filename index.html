            <p class="zz">Jonathon Ng (born 23 December 1995), known professionally as Eden (stylised as EDEN), is an Irish singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer and occasional model.[4] He formerly operated as The Spab Project and later The Eden Project, an alias that was discontinued in 2015. Ng's work as The Eden Project typically featured more conventional styles of electronic dance music such as dubstep and drum and bass, while Eden saw him venturing into a more indie pop style.[5]

                Ng released six EPs and over 70 songs and remixes as The Eden Project. As Eden, he launched his own record label, MCMXCV, on which his debut EP End Credits was released. His second EP, I Think You Think Too Much of Me, was released in August 2016, debuting at No. 43 on the Irish Albums Chart as his first charting music.[6] Eden's debut studio album Vertigo was released on 19 January 2018 and was supported by a world tour. In February 2020 Ng released his sophomore studio album called “no future” which is also followed up by another world tour. “No Future” made it to the top 150 of the all-genres album charts and to the top 10 of the alternative album charts upon one day after release . Prior to the release of End Credits, Ng provided uncredited vocals for Mendum's song "Elysium", as well as credited vocals for Crywolf's song "Stomach It". The vocals from "woah", a track in The Eden Project's Final Call EP, were sampled in the track "I'll Be Your Reason" by Illenium. Following the release of End Credits, Ng provided uncredited vocals on the track "No More" by Pierce Fulton, which was released on 9 November 2015 through Armada Music. Ng also provided vocals for Illenium's "Leaving" in 2017. In 2018, Ng provided uncredited vocals for Jeremy Zucker's "thinking 2 much".

                Ng also performed the song Amnesia, presumably during his last year in secondary school. He later stated, during a livestream, that the song would never have a studio version.
                
                In November 2015, Ng released a cover of Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" for free download.[29] It amassed over 1 million plays on most streaming platforms.</p>
